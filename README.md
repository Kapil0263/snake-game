🎮🐍 Exciting News! I just created a Snake game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! 🎉🚀

I'm thrilled to share that I've built a captivating Snake game from scratch using the power of JavaScript modules, classes, and game development techniques. 🕹️🐍

In this game, I've tackled various challenges and implemented awesome features. Here's a glimpse of what you can expect:

1️⃣ Intelligent Snake Behavior: The snake moves smoothly and efficiently, responding to your commands flawlessly.

2️⃣ Game Over Handling: When the snake dies, the game handles it gracefully, providing a clear indication of your defeat and allowing you to restart the game.

3️⃣ Food Consumption and Length Increase: As you guide the snake, it hunts for food. Each time the snake consumes food, its length increases, adding an extra layer of challenge and excitement.

4️⃣ Restart Functionality: No worries if you lose! Simply press the "OK" button, and you're ready to dive back into the action, starting a fresh new game.

I had an amazing time designing and coding this game, putting my JavaScript skills to the test. It was a great opportunity to learn and experiment with modern web development techniques.

I'd love to hear your feedback and thoughts on my creation.
